  * Need a better to way to select AI difficulty, either with better names or a level that changes how all AIs play.

  * Chuck - Simple AI that will buy actions somewhat randomly, try to buy a balance of coin and actions and although it will not to make big mistakes with its gameplay, does not have a guiding strategy.

 * Sarah - Focuses on a few cards, depending on the game type. Will usually attempt to buy Duchys at a certain point in the game, with logic to understand when that point is, depending on the game.

 * Mary - A mean version of the Sarah AI.

 * Drew - Same as Sarah, but likes a different set of cards. Also buys treasure cards more often than other cards.
